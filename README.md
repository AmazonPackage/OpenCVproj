I followed an OpenCV tutorial on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXlwWbU8l2o) to make a basic face recognition model

The face recognition model is at face_recognition.py, and may be inaccurate at times since OpenCV's face recognizer may fail at times :)
The other files are just what I learnt (and coded) in the tutorial. The photos & videos I used are also uploaded into this depository
